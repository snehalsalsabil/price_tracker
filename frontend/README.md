## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a popular tool for bootstrapping React applications. Below are some key scripts and commands you can use to work with this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the source code. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

**Note: The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.**

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section in the Create React App documentation for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production, placing the files in the `build` folder.\
The build process optimizes the app for best performance, including minification of files and adding hashes to filenames for cache busting. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section in the Create React App documentation for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
